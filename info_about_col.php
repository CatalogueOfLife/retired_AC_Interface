                            System (ITIS) are involving taxonomists throughout

                          <p>This is a work in progress, now covering nearly one-third 
                            of the world's species. The Catalogue is available 
                            on-line as a prototype Dynamic Checklist and also 
                            as a yearly edition (the Annual Checklist), which 
                            is available on CD-ROM as well as on the <a href="http://www.sp2000.org/AnnualChecklist.html" target="_blank">Internet</a>. 
                            This comprehensive index of all known plants, animals, 
                            fungi and micro-organisms is being achieved by accessing 
                            a distributed array of taxonomic databases. </p>
                          <p>About 1.75 million species of plants, animals, fungi 
                            and micro-organisms are 'known' in the sense that 
                            they have been described and named by taxonomists. 
                            Existing taxonomic database projects cover about 40% 
                            of known species. Major resources are needed to establish 
                            indexes for the remaining groups. The CoL programme 
                            aims to stimulate completion of the array of taxonomic 
                            databases. It seeks resources both to support the 
                            completion of the existing databases, and to help 
                            establish new databases in different countries.</p>
                          <p>Member databases of Species 2000 and ITIS are working 
                            together to produce the CoL, and are working closely 
                            with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility 
                            (GBIF). The CoL plays a significant role as the species 
                            index in the GBIF portal (<a href="http://www.gbif.net" target="_blank">www.gbif.net</a>).

                          <p>This fifth release of the Annual Checklist contains 
                            a searchable database with information on the scientific 
                            names and synonyms of more than 527,000 of the world's 
                            species and 41,000 infraspecific taxa in the groups 
                            listed below. Common names and geographic distributions 
                            are given for many but not yet all of these species. 
                            The management classification for arranging all these 
                            data is provided by ITIS above the node of attachment

                          <p>The Catalogue of Life (CoL) delivers a standard set 
                            of data for every known species. These data are drawn 
                            from an array of participating taxonomic databases. 
                            Currently, the majority of these sources are the appropriate 
                            Global Species Databases (GSDs) - that is, databases 
                            containing worldwide coverage of all the species within 
                            one taxon. GSDs are not available for all taxa, so 
                            some sources are Regional Species Databases (RSDs). 
                            The Australian Faunal Directory, the Integrated Taxonomic 
                            Information Service (ITIS) and Species Fungorum are 
                            unusual in that they supply the Catalogue of Life 
                            with some taxonomic sectors of GSD status as well 
                            as regional datasets (RSDs) for other groups. Below, 
                            we use the name 'Source Database' for both GSD and

                          <p>This optional list of geographic records can contain 
                            from 0 to many areas. Distribution information is 
                            currently in various forms in source databases, and 
                            absent from some. </p>
                          <p>Level 4 (Basic Recording Units) of the TDWG World 
                            Geographical Scheme, Edition 2 (2001) is used by some 
                            source databases (and is recommended) for terrestrial 
                            and freshwater organisms (<a href="http://www.tdwg.org/TDWG_geo2.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.tdwg.org/TDWG_geo2.pdf</a>). 
                            In future we aim to adopt a suitable standard for 
                            marine areas. </p>
                          <p>Occurrence status (native, naturalised, etc.) is 
                            not given in many source databases. If being used, 
                            the TDWG Plant Occurrence and Status Scheme (1998) 
                            is recommended as the standard for recording Occurrence 
                            Status (<a href="http://www.tdwg.org/poss_standard.html" target="_blank">http://www.tdwg.org/poss_standard.html</a>).
