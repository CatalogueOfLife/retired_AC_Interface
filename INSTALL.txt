INSTALLATION
=============
1. Setup the database by executing the following lines in the Terminal

    $ mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS col@APP.EDITION@ac';
    $ tar zxvf col@APP.EDITION@ac.sql.tar.gz
    $ mysql -u root col@APP.EDITION@ac < col@APP.EDITION@ac.sql   

    Use the following command to remove the uncompressed SQL file:
    
    $ rm col@APP.EDITION@ac.sql

2. Deploy the application

   Uncompress AC_Interface.tar.gz file and copy the extracted AC_Interface 
   directory into the root folder of the web server.

3. Set up permissions

   The web server has to have read access to all the files and read-write 
   access to the following folders:

   AC_Interface/application/cache --> Cached query results are stored here
   AC_Interface/application/log   --> Any error that may occur is logged here
   
   Example (assuming that the web server user:group is www-data:www-data): 
   
   $ chown -R www-data:www-data AC_Interface
   $ chmod -R 750 AC_Interface

4. Configure the application

   Edit the file AC_Interface/application/configs/config.ini to set the 
   database connection paramters and the Google Analytics tracker id (if any, 
   otherwise leave it empty):

   [production]
   # Database
   database.params.port     = 3306
   database.params.host     = localhost
   database.params.username = here-your-MySQL-username
   database.params.password = here-your-MySQL-password
   database.params.dbname   = here-the-name-of-the-db (col@APP.EDITION@ac in the example 
                              above)

5. Configure Apache

       5.1. Make sure that the rewrite module is enabled.
            $ (sudo) a2enmod rewrite

       5.2. Create an alias inside the Apache VirtualHost in port 80 that points 
            to the *public* folder of the application.
   
       Example:
   
               Alias / "/AC_Interface/public/"
               <Directory "/AC_Interface/public/">
                   Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
                   AllowOverride FileInfo Options
                   Order allow,deny
                   Allow from all
               </Directory>
   
               This configuration will make the application run in the root of 
               the server domain. It is important to add this Alias directive 
               after the other Alias not to override them.
   
               If the application has to run in a subdomain, then replace the 
               alias accordingly:
   
               Alias /path-to-subdomain/ "/AC_Interface/public/"
               <Directory "/AC_Interface/public/">
                   Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
                   AllowOverride FileInfo Options
                   Order allow,deny
                   Allow from all
               </Directory>
   
       IMPORTANT: When running the application in a subdomain it is necessary to
       edit the /AC_Interface/public/.htaccess file to update the 
       RewriteBase parameter accordingly:
   
       RewriteBase /path-to-subdomain/
   
       Finally, restart Apache to have the changes applied. 
   
   NOTE: If the application does not load as expected, checking the Apache logs 
   may help to identify the problem (the Apache 2 error log file is typically 
   located in /var/log/apache2/error.log).
