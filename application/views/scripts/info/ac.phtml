<p>  Each species is linked via the genus and family to the taxonomic classification. Above the node of attachment of each data sector this classification has been agreed by Species 2000 and ITIS as a practical management tool to provide access to the Catalogue, the Catalogue of Life Taxonomic Classification Edition 1. This top level classification has remained unchanged in 2005-2009. However, below the nodes of attachment for each taxonomic sector, the classification originates from the supplier databases and so may change from year to year. Because of these lower level changes there are therefore annual versions of Edition 1 for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

    <p>Each 
species is linked via the genus and family to the taxonomic classification. 
Above the node of attachment of each data sector this classification has 
been agreed by Species 2000 and ITIS as a practical management tool to provide 
access to the Catalogue, the Catalogue of Life Taxonomic Classification Edition 1. This top level classification has remained unchanged 
in 2005-2009. However, below the node of attachment the classification 
originates from the supplier databases and so may change from year to year. Because of this lower level changes there are therefore annual versions of Edition 1 for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008  and 2009.</p>
    <p>Where 
available from the suppliers, infraspecific taxa such as subspecies and 
varieties have also been included but this coverage is variable between 
taxonomic sectors.</p><p>Where possible, a web link back to the supplier's 
own database is provided at the bottom of each species detail page.</p>
<p><strong> CoL</strong><strong> Taxon Identifiers (Taxon LSIDs) </strong></p>
<p> The Catalogue of Life programme started to issue permanent CoL Taxon Identifiers in the 2008 Annual Checklist. Every taxon recognised in the Catalogue, including species and higher taxa, is given a globally unique identifier (GUID) using the Life Science Identifier (LSID) system (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lsids/">sourceforge.net/projects/lsids/</a>). </p>

<p>Where a taxon record remains unchanged in this 2009 edition, it carries the same LSID as in 2008, except that the revision part changes from <em>ac2008</em> to <em>ac2009</em>. New or changed taxa in the 2009 edition receive completely new LSIDs. This will enable the introduction in the next few years of change tracking between editions, so that relationships to taxa in previous editions are recorded, and web-services to alert users to changes in name, classification, circumscription or data. Technical users are already able to inspect changes in the metadata provided by the CoL LSID Resolution Service, and to build their own services using them. For more information, see <a href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/lsid/">www.catalogueoflife.org/lsid/</a>. LSIDs in the 2009 Annual Checklist have been generated by Richard White, Cardiff University, UK. </p>
<p>Our LSIDs are long strings of symbols intended only for computer usage. However, the user interface does show LSID buttons (click, and the LSID is displayed in full), and the LSID is shown at the base of each Species Details screen. This is done so that a user can copy and paste the LSIDs into other software or services: it is NOT intended for them to be read or typed. </p>
<p><b>Functionality of the Annual Checklist</b> </p><p>&#8226; 
Species (and infraspecific taxa) can be located either by searching by name 
or by tracking down through the hierarchical classification.<br> &#8226; 
Searching by name can be done using accepted scientific name, synonym or 
common name. Automatic synonymic and common name indexing takes the user 
directly to the species under its accepted name. The search can use part 
names, or be restricted to complete words.<br> &#8226; Tracking down the 
tree or classification uses accepted names for taxa.<br> &#8226; On each species details page the relevant higher taxa are listed, and provide a link to the relevant node of the hierarchical classification.<br> &#8226; The species details pages link to the source database, usually showing further information.</p><p>This CD contains the Annual Checklist dataset and the software identical to that used on the Web. The structure 
of the Annual Checklist database has been optimised for performance with 
the user interface but is not ideal for importing to other systems. The 
content may be copied subject to the copyright conditions given on the inside
