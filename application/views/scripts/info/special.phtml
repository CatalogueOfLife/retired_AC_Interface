This Special Edition of the Catalogue of Life has been published by arrangement
with the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, in the International Year of
Biodiversity 2010.
</p>
<p>
We rely on the diversity of life to provide us with the food, fuel, medicine
and other essentials we simply cannot live without. Yet this rich diversity is
being lost at a greatly accelerated rate because of human activities.
Cataloguing and sharing information on the names, taxonomy and distribution of
species is fundamental to achieving global biodiversity conservation. Work to
complete the Catalogue of Life helps to underpin knowledge of biodiversity
world-wide.
