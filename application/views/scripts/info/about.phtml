<p class="field_header">The Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life</p>
<p>
The Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life is planned to become a
comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth.
Rapid progress has been made recently and this, the eleventh edition of the
Annual Checklist, contains <b><?php echo $this->stats['species']; ?> </b>
species. Please note that this is probably just slightly over 2/3 of the world's
known species. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient,
and users will notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.</p>
<p>The present Catalogue is compiled with sectors provided by
<?php #echo $this->stats['databases']; ?><b>99</b> taxonomic databases from around the
world. Many of these contain taxonomic data and opinions from extensive networks
of specialists, so that the complete work contains contributions from more than
3,000 specialists from throughout the taxonomic profession. Species 2000 and
ITIS teams peer review databases, select appropriate sectors and
integrate the sectors into a single coherent catalogue with a single
hierarchical classification. It is planned to introduce alternative
taxonomic treatments and alternative classifications, but an important
feature is that for those users who wish to use it, a single preferred
catalogue, based on peer reviews, will continue to be provided.
</p>

<p>As a new development started in 2010, there has been a change in the published
 editions of the Catalogue. This is part of a process in the EC 4D4Life Project 
to bring the Annual Checklist and Dynamic Checklist into better relation with each 
other and ultimately to have only a single product - The Catalogue of Life.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) As a temporary measure what are presently &quot;quarterly editions&quot; of the Catalogue of Life
 are published on each of the 3 quarters between one Annual Checklist (1st April) and the next,
 and the Dynamic Checklist is discontinued for the present. Unlike the old Dynamic Checklist,
 the &quot;quarterly editions&quot; bring together taxonomic sectors harvested by several different processes,
 but all into a single work that will become &quot;The Catalogue of Life&quot;. We expect in future to
 increase the frequency from quarterly, and, in the long term, plan that it will become truly
 dynamic with some sectors harvested semi-automatically from supplier GSDs.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) The publication of the Annual Checklist, as a fixed yearly edition will continue online,
 as a web-service and on DVD.
</p>
<p>
<span class="field_header">&#8226; The Catalogue of Life <span style="font-weight: normal;">(quarterly editions)</span></span>
<br/>
These are progressively enhanced editions in what will become a dynamically 
developing system, made available online and as web-services.
The present frequency is quarterly with releases in July, October, January and 
on 1st April as an Annual Checklist. At all times the latest release is available 
for online access at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/col</a>. Archives of previous releases can be 
downloaded from <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/services"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/services</a>.

<span class="field_header">&#8226; Annual Checklist <span style="font-weight: normal;">of the Catalogue of Life</span></span>

Published each April online, as web-services, and on DVD. At all times 
the latest Annual Checklist is online at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist</a>.
A fixed edition that is published, archived and deposited in public libraries, 
that can be cited, and that can be used as a common catalogue for comparative 
purposes by many organisations. A copy is on this DVD, which is distributed free 
of charge, and identical copies are viewable and downloadable on the website. The 
archive edition for 2011 is at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2011"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2011</a>. Archived 
editions can be found by changing the year in the URL (e.g. /2010, /2009 etc.), and downloadable 
versions and web-services can be found at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/services"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/services</a>.

<p class="field_header">The Catalogue of Life partnership</p>
<p>
In June 2001 the Species 2000 and ITIS organisations, that had previously worked 
separately, decided to work together to create the Catalogue of Life, now 
estimated at 1.9 million species (Chapman, 2009). The two organisations remain 
separate and different in structure. However, by working together in creating a 
common product, the partnership has enabled them to reduce duplication of 
effort, make better use of resources, and to accelerate production. The combined 
Annual Checklist has become well established as a cited reference used for data 
compilation and comparison. For instance, it is used as the principal taxonomic 
index in the GBIF and EoL data portals and recognised by the CBD.
</p>

<p>The scientific policy for the Catalogue of Life programme is developed by the CoL 
Global Team: Guy Baillargeon (Canada), Frank Bisby (UK), Thierry Bourgoin (France), 
Jerry Cooper (New Zealand), Mark Costello (New Zealand), David Eades (USA), Dennis Gordon (New Zealand), 
Hugo Navarrete (Ecuador), Liqiang Ji (China), Heimo Rainer (Austria), Michael Ruggiero (USA), 
Nicolas Bailly (Philippines), Edward Vanden Berghe (USA), Richard White (UK), with further assistance 
from the Regional Hubs.</p>

</a>
The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) is a partnership of federal
agencies and other organisations from the United States, Canada, and Mexico,
with data stewards and experts from around the world (see <a
    href="http://www.itis.gov" target="_blank">www.itis.gov</a>).  
The ITIS database is an automated reference of scientific and common names of 
biota of interest to North America . It contains more than 629,800 scientific  
and common names in all kingdoms, and is accessible via the World Wide Web 
in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese (<a
    href="http://itis.gbif.net" target="_blank">itis.gbif.net</a>).  
ITIS is part of the US National Biological Information Infrastructure  
(<a href="http://www.nbii.gov" target="_blank">www.nbii.gov</a>) and an  
associate member of GBIF
</p>

<p>ITIS is managed by Gerald Guala (Director), Thomas Orrell (Deputy Director),
Michael Ruggiero (Senior Scientific Advisor),
David Nicolson (Data Development Leader),
Mike Frame (Information Technology Leader), Roy McDiarmid (Taxonomy
Leader), Guy Baillargeon (ITIS-Canada Director), and Patricia Koleff
(SIIT-Mexico Director). They are advised and supported by the ITIS
Steering Committee and ITIS Data Stewards.

<p class="field_header">About Species 2000</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.sp2000.org" target="_blank" title="Species 2000">
    <img class="right-align"
    src="<?php echo $this->baseUrl(); ?>/images/sp2000_small.gif"
    width="142" height="62">
</a>
Species 2000 (<a href="http://www.sp2000.org" target = "_blank">www.sp2000.org</a>) is an autonomous federation of taxonomic 
database custodians, involving taxonomists throughout the world. The goal 
is to collate a uniform and validated index to the world's known species. 
Species 2000 is registered as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee 
(registered in England No. 3479405) with six directors, and taxonomic database 
and relevant software organisations from around the world as members. It started 
from a TDWG Task Group; sponsored by CODATA, IUBS and IUMS; is an associate 
participant in GBIF, a data provider to EC LifeWatch; and is recognised by UNEP 
and the CBD. Its Phase II Programme includes EC 4D4Life and i4Life e-infrastructure 
projects. 4D4Life includes the establishment of a Global Multi-Hub Network with Regional 
Centres in China, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil and N. America. i4Life includes 
pipelines for data exchange and checklist harmonisation with GBIF, EBI/NSDC, 
Barcode of Life, IUCN Red List and EoL.
</p>
<p>
Species 2000 is governed by an elected Board of Directors that deals with legal 
and financial matters, and that is advised by the CoL Global Team on scientific 
policy. The Directors are presently: Peter Schalk (Chair, The Netherlands), 
Guy Baillargeon (Convenor of the CoL Global Team, Canada), Frank Bisby (Executive Director, UK), 
Vanderlei Canhos (Brazil), Alex Gray (UK) and Keping Ma (China).
