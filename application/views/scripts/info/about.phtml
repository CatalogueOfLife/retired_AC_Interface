<p class="field_header">The Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life</p>
<p>
The Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life is planned to become a
comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth.
Rapid progress has been made recently and this, the tenth edition of the
Annual Checklist, contains <b><?php echo $this->stats['species']; ?></b>
species. Please note that this is probably just about 2/3 of the world's
known species. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient,
and users will notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.</p>
<p>The present Catalogue is compiled with sectors provided by
<?php echo $this->stats['databases']; ?> taxonomic databases from around the
world. Many of these contain taxonomic data and opinions from extensive networks
of specialists, so that the complete work contains contributions from more than
3,000 specialists from throughout the taxonomic profession. Species 2000 and
ITIS teams peer review databases, select appropriate sectors and
integrate the sectors into a single coherent catalogue with a single
hierarchical classification. It is planned to introduce alternative
taxonomic treatments and alternative classifications, but an important
feature is that for those users who wish to use it, a single preferred
catalogue, based on peer reviews, will continue to be provided.
</p>

<p>The Catalogue is published as two products:</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life:
<?php echo $this->app->edition; ?> Annual Checklist</b><br />
The Annual Checklist is published each year as a fixed edition that can
be cited and used as a common catalogue for comparative purposes by many
organisations. A copy is on the DVD, which is distributed free of
charge, and an identical copy is on the website at <a
    href="<?php echo $this->app->location; ?>">
<?php echo $this->app->location; ?></a>. Archived earlier
editions are also available on the website. This is the preferred
edition for public usage during 2010-2011.</p>

<p>&#8226; <b>Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life: Dynamic
Checklist</b><br />
The Dynamic Checklist is a virtual catalogue operated on the Internet
and available both for users and as an electronic web-service at <a
    href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/dynamic-checklist">
http://www.catalogueoflife.org/dynamic-checklist</a>. The Dynamic
Checklist harvests taxonomic sectors and associated strands of
hierarchical classification dynamically from the source databases across
the internet. The Dynamic Checklist is presently less extensive than the
Annual Checklist because fewer taxonomic sectors have been connected so
far.</p>
<p>It differs in concept from the Annual Checklist in that<br />
(i) the taxonomic records may be updated and the catalogue changed more
frequently than in the Annual Checklist and (ii) the Dynamic Checklist
contains additional regional species checklists (such as the Regional
Checklist - Europe, effectively a Pan-European Species Checklist) not
included in the Annual Checklist. Regional Checklists for N America,
China, Australia and New Zealand are in preparation for linkage in the future
as part of the Catalogue of Life Regional Hub Network.</p>

<p class="field_header">The Catalogue of Life partnership</p>
<p>
In June 2001 the Species 2000 and ITIS organisations, that had
previously worked separately, decided to work together to create the
Catalogue of Life with its estimated 1.9 million species (Chapman, 2009).
The two organisations remain separate and different in structure. However, by
working together in creating a common product, the partnership has
enabled them to reduce duplication of effort, make better use of
resources, and to accelerate production. The combined Annual Checklist
has become well established as a cited reference used for data
compilation and comparison. For instance, it is used as the principal
taxonomic index in the GBIF and EoL data portals and recognised by the
CBD.

The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) is a partnership of federal
agencies and other organisations from the United States, Canada, and Mexico,
with data stewards and experts from around the world (see <a
    href="http://www.itis.gov">http://www.itis.gov</a>). The ITIS database is
an automated reference of scientific and common names of biota of
interest to North America . It contains more than 596,000 scientific and
common names in all kingdoms, and is accessible via the World Wide Web
in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese (<a
    href="http://itis.gbif.net">http://itis.gbif.net</a>). ITIS is part of the
US National Biological Information Infrastructure (<a
    href="http://www.nbii.gov">http://www.nbii.gov</a>) and an associate member
of GBIF
</p>
<p>ITIS is managed by Gerald Guala (Director), Thomas Orrell (Deputy Director),
Michael Ruggiero (Senior Scientific Advisor),
David Nicolson (Data Development Leader),
Mike Frame (Information Technology Leader), Roy McDiarmid (Taxonomy
Leader), Guy Baillargeon (ITIS-Canada Director), and Patricia Koleff
(SIIT-Mexico Director). They are advised and supported by the ITIS
Steering Committee and ITIS Data Stewards.

<p class="field_header">About Species 2000</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.sp2000.org" target="_blank" title="Species 2000">

</a>
Species 2000 (<a href="http://www.sp2000.org">http://www.sp2000.org</a>) is an
autonomous federation of taxonomic database custodians, involving
taxonomists throughout the world. Its goal is to collate a uniform and
validated index to the world's known species. It is a not-for-profit
company limited by guarantee (registered in England No. 3479405) with
six directors and taxonomic database organisations from around the world
as members. It is sponsored by CODATA, IUBS and IUMS; is an associate
participant in GBIF; and is recognised by UNEP and the CBD. There are
two regional programmes: Species 2000 europa (<a
    href="http://www.sp2000europa.org">http://sp2000europa.org</a>), working
with global and regional databases based in Europe and Species 2000
Asia-Oceania (<a href="http://www.sp2000ao.nies.go.jp">http://www.sp2000ao.nies.go.jp</a>)
working to promote taxonomy and taxonomic databasing in that region. The
Phase II Programme is establishing a number of regional/national hubs of
which the European Hub, the Species 2000 China Node (<a
    href="http://www.sp2000.cn">http://www.sp2000.cn</a>), the Brazilian Hub
(El Catalogo da Vida Brazil) and the N America Hub are the first to
appear.</p>
<p>The Species 2000 scientific programme is led by its Team: Guy
Baillargeon (Canada), Frank Bisby (UK), Thierry Bourgoin (France), Jerry
Cooper (New Zealand), Dennis Gordon (New Zealand), Keping Ma (China),
Luciane Marinoni (Brazil), Michael A Ruggiero (USA), Nicolas Bailly
(Philippines), Edward Vanden Berghe (Belgium), Richard J White (UK),
Karen L Wilson (Australia), with further assistance from the Regional Hubs.
