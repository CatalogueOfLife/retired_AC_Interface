Introduction_Source_Databases="The data in the 2009 Annual Checklist have been
provided by 66 databases. Of these, 14 are new to the 2009 edition and 27 have
been updated over the past year. Most datasets include one or more global
species database sectors (GSDs), i.e. datasets being developed to cover all of
the world's species in a particular group of organisms. A few datasets provide
regional information for groups not yet covered globally. The datasets result
from collaboration and editing by many expert taxonomists, whose names are found
in the datasets themselves. A brief summary is listed below giving: database
short and full names; home page on the web; the author(s) or editor(s);
organisation; the group for which data are provided, preceded by its higher
classification; and the number of species and infraspecific taxa included in
this Annual Checklist."
