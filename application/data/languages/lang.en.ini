Introduction_Source_Databases="The data in the 2009 Annual Checklist have been
provided by 66 databases. Of these, 14 are new to the 2009 edition and 27 have
been updated over the past year. Most datasets include one or more global
species database sectors (GSDs), i.e. datasets being developed to cover all of
the world's species in a particular group of organisms. A few datasets provide
regional information for groups not yet covered globally. The datasets result
from collaboration and editing by many expert taxonomists, whose names are found
in the datasets themselves. A brief summary is listed below giving: database
short and full names; home page on the web; the author(s) or editor(s);
organisation; the group for which data are provided, preceded by its higher
classification; and the number of species and infraspecific taxa included in
this Annual Checklist."

At present, some groups are globally complete, some are represented by global sectors that are nearing completion, and others are represented by partial sectors. The global sectors, whether complete or not, are provided by selected, peer reviewed global species databases (GSDs - see definition below) in the Species 2000 federation or by equivalent global sectors of ITIS. The partial sectors are supplied principally by ITIS (N America), but also Species Fungorum and the Australian Faunal Directory, with the result that N American species are sometimes the only species represented for these incomplete groups"
