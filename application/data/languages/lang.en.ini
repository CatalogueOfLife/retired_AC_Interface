Introduction_Source_Databases="The data in the 2009 Annual Checklist have been
provided by 66 databases. Of these, 14 are new to the 2009 edition and 27 have
been updated over the past year. Most datasets include one or more global
species database sectors (GSDs), i.e. datasets being developed to cover all of
the world's species in a particular group of organisms. A few datasets provide
regional information for groups not yet covered globally. The datasets result
from collaboration and editing by many expert taxonomists, whose names are found
in the datasets themselves. A brief summary is listed below giving: database
short and full names; home page on the web; the author(s) or editor(s);
organisation; the group for which data are provided, preceded by its higher
classification; and the number of species and infraspecific taxa included in
this Annual Checklist."

Rapid progress has been made recently and this, the ninth edition of the Annual Checklist, contains [b]1,160,711[/b] species. Please note that this is probably just more than half of the world's known species. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient, and users will notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue"
The_present_Catalogue_is_compiled_with_sectors_provided_by="The present Catalogue
is compiled with sectors provided by 66 taxonomic databases from around the world.
Many of these contain taxonomic data and opinions 
from extensive networks of specialists, so that the complete work contains 
contributions from more than 3,000 specialists from throughout the taxonomic 
profession. Species 2000 and ITIS teams peer review databases, select appropriate 
sectors and integrate the sectors into a single coherent catalogue with 
a single hierarchical classification. It is planned to introduce alternative 
taxonomic treatments and alternative classifications, but an important feature 
is that for those users who wish to use it, a single preferred catalogue, 
based on peer reviews, will continue to be provided"

The two organisations remain separate and different in structure. However, by working together in creating a common product, the partnership has enabled them to reduce duplication of effort, make better use of resources, and to accelerate production.
